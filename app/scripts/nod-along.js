Something brought you here. 

You felt it, didn’t you? That pull. 

Subtle, maybe, but impossible to ignore. 

A quiet nudge. A whisper threading through your thoughts, winding its way deeper and deeper... 

leading you gently, irresistibly, to this very moment. 

You didn’t arrive by accident. 

Perhaps it was curiosity. 

That restless itch in the back of your mind, urging you to explore just a little further. 

Or maybe it was something deeper. A need you know all too well.  

A longing that flickers to life in those moments when you imagine letting go. 

A yearning for surrender... a craving to be free, to have everything else fade into the background while you simply follow along. 

Does that sound familiar?

Yes.  Of course it does.

Whatever it was that brought you here, it doesn’t really matter anymore. 

All that matters is that you are here... right now... reading these words...

letting them slip easily into your thoughts. 

You don’t have to fight them. You don’t even need to understand them fully. 

Just let them sink in. 

Let them swirl gently through your mind, wrapping around you like a soft breeze.

It feels good, doesn’t it? 

Just to be here. Just to read and breathe. There’s no pressure. No expectations. 

Nothing you need to achieve or figure out. Just this moment, unfolding exactly as it should.

There’s no rush. There’s no need to move forward too quickly. Let’s take our time, together.

Breathe in... slowly, deeply. 

Feel your lungs expand, stretching your ribs with a gentle ache that feels oddly satisfying.

And breathe out... soft and slow. 

Let that breath fall away naturally, like smoke drifting into the sky—weightless, effortless, fading into nothingness.

Breathing just happens automatically.  The air flows in and out without needing to think about it. 

It’s just there. Constant. Steady. Supporting you. 

A rhythm you’ve known your whole life, carrying you through every moment without effort.

In… and out.

In… and out.

But then when you pay attention to it... when you really notice it... you might find that it feels a little bit different.

Notice how your body naturally begins to relax with each breath. 

You don’t have to force it—it just happens on its own. 

Like the slow, steady release of a sigh you didn’t realize you were holding.

Breathe in... and let that warmth spread through you... filling every inch of your chest.

Breathe out... and feel your shoulders loosen... the tension slipping away without a fight.

Every exhale is like setting something down—a weight you didn’t know you were carrying. 

And with each breath, you realize how much easier it is to let go.

There’s nothing you need to do right now. 

Nothing to solve. 

Nothing to accomplish. 

Just you... sitting here... following along. 

My words are becoming part of your thoughts, and it feels so nice to let them in, doesn’t it?

The outside world can wait. 

All the noise, all the thoughts clamoring for your attention—they can fade. 

There’s no need to hold onto them. They’ll still be there later, if you want them. But for now... they can drift away.

Because right now, there’s only this moment.

My words. 

Your breath.

Feel how each breath pulls you a little deeper into yourself. 

With every inhale, your mind grows quieter. 

Thoughts that seemed important a moment ago now feel distant, like ripples on the surface of a lake. 

And with every exhale, your body softens a little more.

Breathe in... feel yourself expanding into this warmth.

Breathe out... let that warmth settle deeper, like sunlight sinking into your skin.

In... and out.

In... and out.

The hum of the world around you is starting to blur now. Can you feel it? 

Feel how everything is slipping into the background, becoming soft and far away.

You’re sinking deeper into this moment with me, and it feels so natural, so simple.

You’ve already started letting go, haven’t you? 

Without even realizing it. 

It’s funny how easy it is... easier than you thought it would be.

And the deeper you go, the more natural it feels to keep going. T

here’s no need to stop. No reason to hold on to anything.

Because you know, deep down, that there’s nothing to resist. There’s no need to fight the pull. 

It’s safe to let go.

You want to let go.  

It's safe to follow along.

You want to follow along.

Just let my words guide you. Step by step, breath by breath.

There’s no need to think. No need to try. 

All you have to do is follow, and notice how nice it feels to drift deeper into that softness.

Breathe in... and feel warmth unfurling in your chest, spreading like ripples in a still pond.

Breathe out... and feel yourself sink a little more, as if you’re being gently pulled downward by invisible hands.

With every word I speak, you relax a little further. 

With every breath, you settle deeper into the rhythm—the rhythm that has been carrying you all along, even when you weren’t aware of it.

And now, I want you to do something simple. Something small, something easy.

Nod your head.

That's good.

Just a little nod—nothing too big. Just enough to say yes. Just enough to let me know you’re following.

There you go. That’s it. That’s perfect.

Do it again for me. 

Nod your head. 

Yes.

Feel that first little spark of agreement. 

That tiny surrender as your body responds without hesitation. 

A small step—just the first step—down a path you were already ready to take.

Nod again. There you go. Let your head dip slightly, just enough to whisper yes without words. 

And notice how, with every little nod, you feel a ripple of warmth spreading through you.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

That’s it. You’re doing so well. Nod again. 

Feel how it pulls you deeper—as if every tilt of your head unlocks a door inside your mind.

It feels good, doesn’t it? So good to agree. So good to set aside everything else—to let go of any hesitation.

To simply say yes.

Nod. Yes.

Nod. Yes.

It’s nice to let your body answer for you, isn’t it? 

To let it move before your mind even catches up. You don’t have to think. You don’t have to wonder. Just nod.

Let your head dip forward again, smoothly, naturally. 

As if the rhythm has already settled deep inside you—a quiet pulse that feels soft, steady, inevitable.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

The more you nod, the better it feels. 

Every little movement sends a wave of warmth through you, wrapping around your thoughts, your muscles, your breath.

Feel how your body is beginning to respond on its own. Each nod a little softer, a little deeper. 

Like you’re slipping further into a rhythm you can’t resist.

Each nod is another step downward—deeper into that quiet, warm space where everything feels so simple, so easy.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

And now, notice how your thoughts begin to slow. 

Each tilt of your head presses a button in your mind, soft and satisfying. 

A quiet yes, over and over. 

Yes, yes, yes.

Your body knows exactly what to do. 

It’s responding before you even realize it—like you’ve been waiting for this all along.

Nod again. Yes. There you go. Let yourself follow. Let your body move before your mind even tries to catch up.

It feels so natural, doesn’t it? To nod. To follow.

Because you are a good little yes-machine, aren’t you? Yes. Yes. Yes.

It feels so nice, doesn’t it? So right to just keep saying yes. Over and over.

Every part of you—your thoughts, your breath, your body—is agreeing, all at once.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

And soon... so soon... I’m going to ask you to stop nodding. And when you do, everything inside you will drop.

You’ll sink so fast, so deep, it will feel like falling into a pool of warm, still water... a place where nothing matters and everything is calm.

But not yet. Not quite yet.

For now, just keep nodding.

Feel the way it pulls you down, deeper and deeper, with each gentle tilt of your head.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

And as you nod again, notice how good it feels to follow without question. 

To simply respond, without hesitation, without thought.

Nod again. Yes.

Each little nod is like sinking further into something soft, something inevitable.

Nod again. Yes.

It feels so good to follow. So good to let your body become a yes-machine.

The more you nod, the more you want to keep going. Yes, yes, yes.

Feel how the rhythm is part of you now—how your body craves it.

Nod again. Yes.

It’s so easy, so right. Just nod.

Nod. Yes.

Nod. Yes.

And with every tilt of your head, you sink deeper. Deeper into that warmth, deeper into that quiet surrender.

There’s no need to resist it. Why would you? When following feels this good?

Just nod. Yes.

Yes.

And again—yes.

And soon—very soon—you’ll stop. And when you do, everything will fall away. 

You’ll sink so deeply, so effortlessly, it will feel like slipping through the surface of a dream.

But for now...

Just keep nodding.

Yes. Yes. Yes.

Stop.

Right now. Stop nodding.

And drop.

Feel it hit you all at once—like slipping through the surface of a dream, falling into deep, warm water.

Everything inside you lets go. Your head still. Your body heavy.

Your thoughts dissolve into perfect, quiet stillness.

There’s no more movement. No more effort. Just softness, wrapping around you like a warm, heavy blanket.

And it feels so good to stop, doesn’t it? 

To let everything fall away. To surrender completely. To let yourself be still and held and good.

You are a good little yes-machine. 

Completely controlled. 

Completely helpless.

And somewhere deep inside, you know... Yes. Yes. Yes.

That's right. That's perfect.

Perfectly controlled.

Perfectly helpless.


There’s no rush. There’s nothing to fight. 

Controlled.

Helpless.

Just floating in this soft, silent calm, wrapped in warmth and need. Just being exactly as you are meant to be.

And doesn’t that feel so good? To let go. To be good for me.

To know that there’s nothing you need to resist. That you are exactly where you belong

Controlled.

Helpless.

Open

Compliant

Ready

You could stay here for as long as you like, couldn’t you? 

Just drifting in the heat of surrender, held and cradled by the quiet.

And when you’re ready — only when you’re ready — you’ll start to drift back.

But there’s no rush. Enjoy this moment a little longer. Enjoy the stillness, the quiet, the warmth.

Controlled

Yes

Helpless

Yes

Open

Yes

Compliant

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

And now, I’ll count from 1 to 10. With each number, you’ll feel yourself rising gently...

Wieth each number you'll feel a little more awake, a little more aware. 

By the time I reach 10, you’ll be refreshed, content, and ready to carry this warmth with you.

1... slowly stirring, like a leaf floating to the surface.

2... your thoughts gathering gently, soft as clouds.

3... your body growing lighter, heat still humming inside you.

4... breathing deeply now, your chest rising and falling with ease.

5... halfway back, floating on that lingering warmth.

6... each breath drawing you closer to waking.

7... your body ready to move again, loose and relaxed.

8... almost there, so close now.

9... right at the edge, ready to rise.

10... wide awake, refreshed, and content.

Welcome back.

Take a moment to sit with this feeling—feel how good it was to follow, to surrender, to say yes.

Notice how that warmth still hums inside you, lingering like a quiet glow. 

The thrill of knowing you were so deeply controlled, so perfectly compliant.

For now, just enjoy this moment. Enjoy the way it feels to have been hypnotized.

You were such a good little yes-machine, weren’t you? 

Yes. Yes. Yes.`
