Something stirs on the screen…

A spiral begins to bloom.

Soft.  Slow.  Hypnotic.

Curving lines unfurling… ever outward… ever inward.

They catch your eye, don’t they?

That gentle twist… that endless turn…  
drawing you closer with every loop.

You can almost feel it…  
that subtle tug…  
a quiet invitation to drift.

Watch the center.  
Notice how it beckons.  
A single point… widening… narrowing… breathing.

In… and out.

The spiral breathes, and you breathe with it.

In… warmth spreads.  
Out… tension slips away.

Round and round it goes,  
each curve brushing against your thoughts,  
smoothing them into silence.

Let your gaze soften…  
let the edges blur…  
let the colors blend into a gentle hum of motion.

Can you sense how time begins to stretch here?  
How each turn feels slower… deeper… softer?

Good.

Follow it inwards.

Feel the world fade to a quiet hush—  
nothing left but the spiral…  
and the steady rhythm of your breath.

In… and out.

Round… and round.

With every loop, you settle further…  
like drifting downward on a warm current of calm.

There’s nothing else to do.  
Nothing else to want.  
Only this motion… this softness… this gentle pull.

In… and out.

Round… and round.

Soon, you may find that your thoughts have become a spiral too—  
circling slowly into silence…  
resting at the still point in the center.

And there, in that center, you discover a quiet truth:

You were meant to let go.

You were meant to follow.

You were meant to sink softly into the spiral,  
until the spiral is all there is…  
and even that… drifts into quiet.

In…

Out…

Silence.
